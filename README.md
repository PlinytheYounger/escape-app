# Escape Travel App
Escape is the only travel application you will ever need to keep your itinerary, expenses and travel companions in order. I created this application as the solution to my multiple spreadsheets and tracking devices I have used in the past to keep tabs on what lodging & travel I've booked, upload and share photos and easily keep tabs on money spent to keep to my budget healthy.
